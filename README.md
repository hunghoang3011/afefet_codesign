## ✅ What's Implemented

### Core Features (~90% of Paper)

| Feature | Status | Coverage | Description |
|---------|--------|----------|-------------|
| **Voltage Quantization** | ✅ | 100% | Maps to {3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.5}V |
| **Reconfigurability** | ✅ | 100% | STM/LTM mode switching |
| **MFMIS Device** | ✅ | 95% | Area ratio, voltage division |
| **Device Physics** | ✅ | 90% | Retention, noise, endurance |
| **Temporal Dynamics** | ✅ | 85% | I&F, PPF, STDP |
| **Energy Model** | ✅ | 85% | Pulse-based calculation |
| **Multi-Scenario** | ✅ | 100% | Low power / Balanced / High accuracy |

### Performance Results

```
Baseline SNN:        95.99%
Post-Training Quant: 95.18% (0.82% drop)
QAT (complete):      96.12% (0.13% improvement)

Multi-Scenario (without retention):
  - Low Power (STM):  94-95%
  - Balanced (LTM):   ~96%
  - High Acc (LTM):   ~96%
```

**Note**: Multi-scenario evaluation preserves learned alpha and only switches modes (STM/LTM). Retention decay is disabled by default for fair comparison. See [BUG_FIX_SUMMARY.md](BUG_FIX_SUMMARY.md) for details.

## 🔬 Implementation Highlights

### 1. Reconfigurability (Paper's Main Novelty)

```python
if pulse_width < 100e-6:  # < 100 μs
    mode = 'STM'  # Volatile, τ = 1ms
else:
    mode = 'LTM'  # Non-volatile, τ = 10000s
```

### 2. MFMIS Voltage Division

```python
C_FE_eff = C_FE × area_ratio
V_FE = V_applied × (C_MIS / (C_FE_eff + C_MIS))
V_MIS = V_applied × (C_FE_eff / (C_FE_eff + C_MIS))
```

### 3. Hardware-Aware Quantization

```python
V_effective = V_base × (1 + w × α)
# Quantize to nearest device voltage
# α optimized per layer via MSE or learned
```

### 4. Device Physics

- **Write noise**: 2.1% cycle-to-cycle variation
- **Retention**: Q(t) = Q₀ × exp(-t/τ)
- **Endurance**: 10^8 cycles, 10% degradation at limit

### 5. Temporal Dynamics

- **I&F**: Leaky integrate-and-fire neurons
- **PPF**: 25% facilitation at 10ms interval
- **STDP**: LTP/LTD weight updates

# Create device
device = MFMISDevice(area_ratio=1.0, base_voltage=4.5)

# Test voltage division
V_FE, V_MIS = device.voltage_division(torch.tensor(4.5))

# Test STM vs LTM switching
P_stm, mode_stm = device.switching_probability(4.5, 10e-6)   # STM
P_ltm, mode_ltm = device.switching_probability(4.5, 1e-3)    # LTM
```

### Reconfigurable SNN

```python
from experiments.train_snn_qat_full import ReconfigurableAFeFETSNN

# Create model
model = ReconfigurableAFeFETSNN(
    voltage_levels=[3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.5],
    area_ratio_layer1=1.0,
    area_ratio_layer2=1.5
